/* 9. The last feature we're going to add to our app is an option to change the them from light to dark and back,
     with the click of a button. We will be using the concept of STATE and React's useState hook to achieve this*/

/* 9a. Firstly, Add a button to your main div, below the WeatherCards div.*/

/* 9b. Note that React Hooks can only be used inside a function, copy paste your entire code into app.jsx */

/* 9d. Now write a render statement that renders only an App component in the root div */
